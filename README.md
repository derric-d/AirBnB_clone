# Airbnb Clone - The Console

This is our first step towards building our first full web application: the AirBnB clone. 

## Requirements

### Python Scripts

* Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
* All your files will be interpreted/compiled on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS using python3 (version 3.4.3)
* All your files should end with a new line
* The first line of all your files should be exactly #!/usr/bin/python3
* A README.md file, at the root of the folder of the project, is mandatory
* Your code should use the PEP 8 style (version 1.7 or more)
* All your files must be executable
* The length of your files will be tested using wc
* All your modules should have a documentation (python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").__doc__)')
* All your classes should have a documentation (python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").MyClass.__doc__)')
* All your functions (inside and outside a class) should have a documentation (python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").my_function.__doc__)' and python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").MyClass.my_function.__doc__)')

### Python Unit Tests

* Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
* All your files should end with a new line
* All your test files should be inside a folder tests
* You have to use the unittest module
* All your test files should be python files (extension: .py)
* All your test files and folders should start by test_
* Your file organization in the tests folder should be the same as your project
* e.g., For models/base_model.py, unit tests must be in: tests/test_models/test_base_model.py
* e.g., For models/user.py, unit tests must be in: tests/test_models/test_user.py
* All your tests should be executed by using this command: python3 -m unittest discover tests
* You can also test file by file by using this command: python3 -m unittest tests/test_models/test_base_model.py
* All your modules should have a documentation (python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").__doc__)')
* All your classes should have a documentation (python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").MyClass.__doc__)')
* All your functions (inside and outside a class) should have a documentation (python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").my_function.__doc__)' and python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").MyClass.my_function.__doc__)')

## Execution

The shell should work like this in interactive mode:

```bash
$ ./console.py
(hbnb) help

Documented commands (type help <topic>):
========================================
EOF  all  count  create  destroy  help  quit  show  update

(hbnb) quit
$
```

And also like this in non-interactive mode:

```bash
$ echo "help" | ./console.py
(hbnb)
Documented commands (type help <topic>):
========================================
EOF  all  count  create  destroy  help  quit  show  update

(hbnb)
$
```

## Commands
* create: Creates a new instance of BaseModel, saves it (to the JSON file) and prints the id
* show: Prints the string representation of an instance based on the class name and id
* destroy: Deletes an instance based on the class name and id (save the change into the JSON file)
* all: Prints all string representation of all instances based or not on the class name
* update: Updates an instance based on the class name and id by adding or updating attribute (save the change into the JSON file)
